# countdownv2
This is a simple workout timer written in Kotlin.
The app has three fields for input. User needs to indicate workout and rest duration and number of interval.
The countdown for workout will begin when the user click the Start button. 
Upon completion of workout countdown, the rest countdown will automatically begin.
Once rest countdown has ended, the interval count will increase. 
Depending on the number of interval, the app will start a new workout countdown or will end.
Once the workout has ended, the app will trigger a notification indicating the workout is completed.
I'm a beginner in android mobile app so please bear with me with regards to UI and UX and or coding.
